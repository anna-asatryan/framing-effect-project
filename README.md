# Framing Effect in Everyday Decision-Making

## Overview
This project examines the **framing effect**, a cognitive bias in which equivalent information leads to different decisions depending on whether it is presented in a positive (gain) or negative (loss) frame. The study tests whether framing influences everyday consumer decisions across **health, financial, and environmental** contexts.

## Research Question
**Does positive framing increase willingness to act compared with negative framing of the same information?**

---

## Method
- **Design:** Between-subjects experiment  
- **Independent Variable:** Frame Type (Positive vs. Negative)  
- **Participants:** 30 adults  
- **Measures:**  
  - Binary decision (Yes/No)  
  - Confidence rating (1–7)  
  - Perceived effectiveness (1–7)  

Participants evaluated three equivalent scenarios differing only in framing.

---

## Key Results
- Positive framing dramatically increased acceptance rates.
- Positive framing increased perceived effectiveness.
- Negative framing unexpectedly produced higher confidence.
- Framing effects generalized across all decision domains.

---

## Tools & Analysis
- Data analyzed in **R**
- Statistical methods included chi-square tests, Welch’s t-tests, and mixed-design ANOVA
